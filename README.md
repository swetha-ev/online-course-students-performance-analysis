## 🧹 Data Cleaning (Excel)

Data cleaning and preparation were done using Excel with the following techniques:

- **Find & Replace**: To remove unwanted characters and fix formatting.
- **`PROPER()`**: To standardize text formatting (e.g., names, countries).
- **`IF()` Statements**: For conditional value handling and error checks.
- **`AVERAGE()`**: Used to fill missing feedback ratings or time spent values.
- **`ISBLANK()`**: To identify and manage missing values.
- **Data Type Formatting**: Converted columns to correct types (Date, Number, Text).

## 📊 Data Visualization (Power BI)

The cleaned data was visualized using Power BI, creating an interactive dashboard that includes:

### Visual Elements:
- **Bar Charts**: Course categories and student count by country.
- **Line Charts**: Time-series trends of engagement and enrolment.
- **Forecasting Line Chart**: To predict future engagement trends.
- **Gauge Chart**: Overall course completion rate.
- **Tables and Matrix**: Detailed breakdowns by student and course.
- **Slicers**: Filters for country, experience level and course category.
- **Drill-through**: For deep-dive insights by course category and country.
